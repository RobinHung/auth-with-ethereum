In this proejct, the user will use `web3.personal.sign` method to sign a piece of random string assigned by the server as a challenge nonce. After being signed by the Metamask account, the signature will be passed to the server, and the server will use `recoverPersonalSignature` from [eth-sig-util](https://github.com/MetaMask/eth-sig-util) to recover the address from the signature (with the nonce generated by the server) and to verify if the recovered address is identicial to the Metamask Ethereum account.
